# BCG-GenAI-Financial-Chatbot
An AI-powered financial chatbot built during the BCG GenAI job simulation on Forage. This Python-based project interprets financial data from 10-K and 10-Q reports for companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Tesla. Users can query revenue, net income, total assets, and compare financial metrics across companies and years.
